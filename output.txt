asdasdtext.txt CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This study attempts to model the latent social influence among individuals based on their patterns of collaborations in a social network via the FM approach. Preliminary ex perimental results on the small DBLP dataset for the data mining community show that the proposed approach provides a better predictive model than several baselines. In future work, we will conduct experiments on larger data sets with various fields of research communities. In addition, other auxiliary information, such as the temporal information of the publications [5], will be included and analyzed in our further experiments. as as as a as.
